    <p>I am very hornord to be able to participate in this wonderful event again this year. <br />
    I wondered what to write. <br />
    If my friend come to Japan first time I wondered how I would do hosphitality. <br />
    Of course , there will be various requests depending on. <br />
    I would like to write some foods what I wanna recommend to my friend in Japan. </p>

    <p>① curry bread <span class="spoiler">(カレーパン)</span><br />
    There are many kind of types<br />
    fried in oil like a donut , it like baking in the oven , and so on. <br />
    I think Japanese curry and bread go very well. </p>

    <p>②Takoyaki <span class="spoiler">(たこ焼き)</span><br />
    Everyone loves Japanese takoyaki. I hope so <img src={yotsubaYay} className={'emote'} /> <br />
    If you are biginner of takoyaki , please try to look for where you can line up like <span class="spoiler">”銀だこ” ”くくる”</span> and so on. There are many taste good takoyaki at convenience stores and supermarket side dish corners. <br />
    If you are advanced of takoyaki ,please try to eat Akashiyaki <span class="spoiler">明石焼き</span><br />
    The dough of Akashiyaki is softer than takoyaki.  That is eat with Dashi     soup stock ?🧐</p>

    <p>③Strawberry short cake <span class="spoiler">(イチゴショートケーキ🍰)</span></p>

    <p>Anyway , I love it. 😋 <br />
    There are variety strawberry cakes in Japan <br />
    Convenience stores , big cake shops , small cake shops. <br />
    If you are super rich person , please go to ”SATSUKI” at Hotel New Otani. It's very expensive , but it's very delicious.  😋 Super one is maybe over 3000yen for one piece , but I remembered there were some kind of cheaper one. </p>

    <p>④Umaka stick <span class="spoiler">(うまか棒)</span></p>

    <p>It's Japanese snacks.  There are many kinds of taste, for example <br />
    the taste of corn potage , <br />
    They are 10yen per piece</p>

    <p>This time , I introduced the ones that are relatevely easy to get anywhere in  Japan.<br />
    And if I have the opportunity I will recommend to my friend <br />
    「Conveyor belt sushi restaurant」<br />
    「Chinese restaurant at local place in Japan」<br />
    「Japanese Soba and Udon restaurant」<br />
    「Japanese coffee shop」</p>

    <p>for next time to write. </p>

    <p>Thank you very much for reading my not connected essay. <br />
    I wish you all Merry Christmas. <br />
    Thank you<br />

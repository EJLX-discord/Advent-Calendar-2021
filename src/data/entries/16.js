    <p><u>1. Self-introduction</u><br />
    Hello, everyone (woof woof)<br />
    I‚Äôll introduce myself for those who don‚Äôt know me. I‚Äôm ayumminu, and you can call me ayu.<br />
    ( It's not important, but I'm thinking of changing my pfp, which I drew to a cuter doggo. )<br />
    Do you remember why you participated in this server? I came here three and a half years ago to improve my English because of the link that was posted on Duolingo‚Äôs bulletin board. When I had been a puppy, I hadn‚Äôt studied English hard, which made it very difficult for me to communicate with people. Sadly, I only remembered that unnatural expressions like English that Japanese learn in junior high school.<br />
    Also, the phrase ‚ÄúI was born‚Äù, which I learned in an English song didn‚Äôt stuck in my head for some reason. For these reasons,  I've been through various difficulties for studying English.<br />
    To put who am I in one word, a doggo that has been studying English.</p>

    <p><u>2. About 2020</u><br />
    A sad event for me happened in 2020. It was the saddest event ever happened in my entire life. And I've stopped using discord for about two months. At the same time, I‚Äôve stopped studying English. The about two month later, I stared using discord again, but I was very emotionally unstable. If it could be described, it would be dark days that made me feel like I didn't care about my own money.<br />
    2020 was the year that the covid-19 was going around in Japan than at present. Do you remember what you were doing? Actually, I‚Äôve worked remotely from April of 2020 to August of 2021. At this time,I felt more comfortable that I didn't have to talk to people face-to-face because I was be in gloomy mood. Then, this self-quarantine period had positive effects to rest my mind. Working remotely that I didn't have to commute to work was very good for me.<br />
    One day, I noticed that I hadn‚Äôt studied English in about six months. You would think six months were a long period but I didn't feel like it would be that long. And you would know what happened if a doggo that only could remember unnatural English or ‚ÄúI was born‚Äù didn't study English for six months. I thought I needed to study English again step by step.<br />
    In summary, last year was a necessary and important period to be considerate myself.</p>

    <p><u>3. About 2021 and My New Year's Resolution</u><br />
    For me, 2020 was so blank year, that 2021 is the year I restarted. First of all, practicing easy English words everyday motivated me to try harder. Next, my failure to understand English grammar inspired me to study more. (As a matter of fact, I should practice it because even now I don't know well it ) In short, the study time has increased compared to 2020.</p>

    <p>Lately, I feel full of eagerness to try to do things I haven't experienced yet.<br />
    I'm going to accumulate knowledge while enjoying this new normal life style.</p>

    <p>Finally, thank you for reading my Advent Calendar!<br />

    <p>Hello, nice to meet you everyone. I&apos;m Japanese and studying English as you know. Today, I want to explain why I study English. At 1st my father was English teacher in junior high school. Since I was child, I have been time to see foreign person. And 2ndly, I like cartoon. I have been grown with Superman, Tom and Jerry, Dexter&apos;s Laboratory etc. So I&apos;m interested about English and American culture. Finally, when I had internet, I played Pokemon. Pokemon has internet battle system. I made foreign friend using internet, and played with her. My 1st foreign friend is Finnish person. So I&apos;m interested in Scandinavian person especially. I thought that I want to have foreign girlfriend. It was so big experience for me. Today, I don&apos;t have girlfriend, but foreign people is very interesting. That&apos;s all. Thanks for your reading. <br />

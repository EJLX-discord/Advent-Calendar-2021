    <strong><u>#2021 Advent calendar 17th</u></strong>
  </div>
  <div className={'en'}>
    <p>Hello everyone! <img src={pikaWave} className={'emote'} /> I write the advent calendar for 17th. <br />
    I‚Äôve thought what to write for the advent calendar since the day I applied to this event. But I don‚Äôt come up with any proper topic even though I thought of easy and fun topics one by one while taking a class. <img src={satanicPikachu} className={'emote'} /><br />
    Anyways, this year is the first opportunity to participate in the advent calendar, so let me start with self-introduction at first. <img src={rooDolph} className={'emote'} /> <br />
    My original name on discord is En. My current name uwu derives from the face of a cute little Clefairy of my pfp uwu. As you know I love Pokemon and play Pokemon Go in my free time. Particularly I love Gible. ‚ù§Ô∏è Her trotting around with waving her short arms like a üë∂  is literally pretty precious. The feeling when I looking at her is like in a dream. <img src={pikaPat} className={'emote'} />  Needless to say, she is the best buddy for me in Pokemon Go.<br />
    Next, about the dates when I came to this server. I came here in this March. Then I was interested in learning English, but English classes I had taken were only good time for taking a nap and it was the first time to chat in English, so I was really nervous. <img src={GoodNight} className={'emote'} />   After taking a deep breath, I headed to beginner_en_chat at first cuz there was no #üë∂level_en_chat. My English was like barely enable me to write ‚ÄúI have a pen‚Äù, though most people do never exclude me and paid attention to me, so I hadn‚Äôt thought to leave this server with awkward. <img src={roosantayay} className={'emote'} />  To chat in English was something new and fun cuz I could say everything including flirty words like I had never said in real life even to my friends LOL. <img src={squirtlederp} className={'emote'} />  So I gradually came to want to be able to chat in English fluently. <img src={naruhodone} className={'emote'} />  <br />
    These days, my habitat has changed to just_hanging_out (I don‚Äôt come here as much as previous though). I ‚Äòd like to spend amusing English life there with you all. <img src={yotsubaYay} className={'emote'} /> <br />
    As I wrote above, my goal is chatting in English fluently, including talking. üòé So I‚Äôll go to vc next year. For that, I sometime watch an English video at YouTube as the first step of listening. <img src={roosantablind} className={'emote'} /> I‚Äôll paste the link of my learning English resource below don‚Äôt miss it! <img src={bulbaDerp} className={'emote'} /><br />
    Oops! There‚Äôs no space to write the main theme. I‚Äôll write it next opportunity LOL <img src={charmanDerp} className={'emote'} /> <br />
    Thank you for reading my long long my self-introduction till the end. <img src={rooSantaAww} className={'emote'} /> <br />
    I hope everyone will have the great Christmas and have a better next year! <img src={yotsubaPray} className={'emote'} /> </p>

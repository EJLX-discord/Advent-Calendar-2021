    <strong>#2021 Advent Calendar, Day  2</strong>
  </div>
  <div className={'en'}>
    <p>Hello, everyone! I am Mikan who is in charge of the Advent Calendar 2021 for the 2nd. day. Honestly, I am very nervous because my trun is after the wonderful essay which is written by Shini.<br />
    Today is the 10th day since I joined here. I know that I'm a newcomer here, but I thought that I would like to talk about what made me want to learn English and what I want to do here from now when I saw the announcement of this event. </p>

    <p>Before that, I'm really thankful for everyone spending their time talking with me and painstakingly teaching me. Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart. I have already seen and talked with a lot of amazing people here too. I enjoy learning English here.</p>

    <p>Actually, it wasn't very recently that I decided to learn English. I started to play a game since the corona-virus started to go around, and I luckily participated in the world competition this autumn.<br />
    At that time, I met one American friend. He was one of great players in the game, but he had to quit the game for his work after the world competition.<br />
    I don't think that I talked with him much. Probably only a handful... Because I couldn't understand what he was talking about in English well. He looked like having other friends too, but he gave me his account somehow. Then, he only told me "enjoy" and he left.<br />
    I still don't understand what he had been thinking. Now, I am really enjoying playing it, as he hoped. Thanks to him, I have been having a lot of new experiences, both fun and sad.<br />
    However, I may be still regret the fact that I could not have more chance to talk to him and understood him. That is why I am learning English now. If one day we meet again, I would like to say thank you to him properly first of all.</p>

    <p>Now, I would appreciate if you could kindly point out my mistakes without hesitation. I would love to learn English properly here. Also, the members here have profound knowledge of multiple languages, so I would like to learn many things with everyone.<br />
    I have known that all my friends from overseas talk to me with simple English, and speak slowly. Even in my poor English, they try hard to understand what I say. I really appreciate to their kindness, but I would love to not only rely on that, but also to improve myself.</p>

    <p>Thank you for reading this. I hope that we can become good friends!!<br />
    Last but not least... Happy Birthday, my friend Bishop!!!</p>

    <p>"We are finished? You must be kidding. It's so, baby? You must do such a troublesome thing for fun, it's just so, baby?"</p>

    <p>I believe that one of the most beautiful Japanese Christmas songs is SION's this song "Town in winter is". I can remember the first time I had listened to this song. The voice followed the melody with an impressive husky voice. It was out of tune so I felt something painful in contrast to the background's sophisticated playing. But it strongly gripped my teenage mind. What a strange and beautiful song! I still can't say that I am not a dutiful fan of SION but I believe that this is a miracle song.</p>

    <p>As you know, I am 46 years old guy now. Yes, I can't say I am still young. And I can see this song's meaning. Life isn't always sweet. Everybody can feel or experience bitter events like losing love this song describes. I have never fallen in love so I just imagine but growing ourselves in love might be difficult sometimes. Love is the act at least two people try to do together. You two sometimes feel the misunderstanding of another people's mind.</p>

    <p>In short, love is, or life is troublesome. It sometimes might not sweet. But I don't want to forget this song's other impressive line. "I feel that someone is looking at us quietly in town in winter". I think this has the meaning that someone like God is always looking at us quietly... then, this song has a little bit religious. I can't say if SION is a dutiful believer but just say that the character in this song has a very sensitive mind.</p>

    <p>I'm sorry! There are too many things if I remember this song. It's too long and complicated so I will write about them in my journal step by step. All I wanted to do was (has been?) just introducing this song to everyone to celebrate holy Christmas.</p>

    <p>"And I have, even I have, something as soft regret in this period as I had the things I couldn't have done".</p>

    <p>Sorry for this messed translation!</p>

    <p>Greetings everyone! Aoi here.<br />
    How are y’all doin? It’s getting pretty cold here but I hope y’all doing just fine.<br />
    And for my entry, I’d like to preach how cute Sakura Miko(A VTuber) is… we could make a religion out of her, just look at these screenshots-</p>
    <img src={image} alt={'Screenshot'} className={'entry-image'} />
    <p>well that was actually just a joke. I actually had a hard time thinking on what to write but I finally settled on talking about <i><strong>Pokémon</strong></i>.</p>

    <p>Have you guys ever played the first generation?<br />
    They started with the Pokémon Red and Green then Blue and Yellow came afterwards.<br />
    Though unfortunately Pokémon Green’s international version wasn’t released.<br />
    But here’s the interesting part. They actually chose the colour red and green after the world’s most known plumbers. Yes, Mario and Luigi. Not really a mind-blowing fact but it’s pretty cool knowing that Mario actually took part in the game.</p>
    
    <p>What’s more, the title <i>Pokémon…</i> <strong>Pocket Monsters</strong> itself has an interesting origin too.<br />
    The name was originally named <i>Capsule Monsters</i> which was inspired by <strong>gashapons</strong>. However, <i>capsule</i> was already trademarked which made things complicated so they decided to change the name.  One of the developers blurted out “these balls(currently pokéball/monster ball in jp) can be put in a coat pocket etc… hmmm“ and everyone liked that thought and finally agreed on naming it Pocket Monsters(Pokémon for the international version because the word Pocket Monster was a lewd slang).</p>

    <p>I’ll change the subject a bit though but I believe Pokémon is also one of the most well-known animes with Dragon Ball, One Piece and Naruto. Though I’ve never watched them because they’re too long but surprisingly, I was able to watch Pokèmon forever to the point that it’s probably the anime I’ve watched the most. Not only that but It’s also my most played game starting from Leaf Green→ Sapphire→ Diamond → Heart Gold→ White→ White2→ Omega Ruby→ Ultra Sun overall with a whopping 5000hours. </p>

    <p>What’s so great about Pokémon is that the adventure part itself is so satisfying that that itself is worth the price and after beating the champion, the next step would be trying to capture the legendary pokémons(this stuff is also fun af). I personally like capturing these guys with a normal pokéball for the swags and just because I didn’t like the design of the masterball and ultraball. <img src={lul} className={'emote'} /> If anyone also beat the game and captured legendaries, congrats! You are a full-fledge casual player. To take it to the next level, there are also a lot of things to remember at first. PkRus(PokéVirus), EV, IV, every Pokémon’s Base Stats, Bad-Statuses hidden effects etc. It’s gonna take longer than I expected so let’s leave it at there. So what’s so great about it is there may be alot of things to remember at first but it also shows the great diversity you can do in a battle. Well indeed, strong pokémons are gonna be used alot and people use those against each other but trying to beat those with just a Zigzagoon? that’s spicy. I really hope some of you get interested but just a warning, you would get rekt alot on your early attempts. I did. But <s>I’m a masochist so it was not really bad</s> it made me notice how Pokémon can be really deep. That’s it for now.<br />
    Sorry for the wall of text and what I just wanted to say is</p>

    <p>I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.<br />
    Hope everyone’s gonna be fine aaaand I’m out.</p>

    <p>P.S. Corrections are gladly accepted. <img src={pekoraSalute} className={'emote'} /></p>

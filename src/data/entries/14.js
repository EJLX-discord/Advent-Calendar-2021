    <p>Hi guys!<br />
    It's my 1st time to appear in Ad-Cale this time. First of all thank you for organizing an amazing event like that. I will simply share my experience of my travels. <br />
    Please get ready to face a real adventure! <br />
    -----------------------</p>
    
    <p>It was when I was traveling through Spain. I was doing hitch-hiking since I had no money to travel. Transport fee and hotel fee were the biggest damage to my wallet, so I decided to hitch-hike. </p>

    <p>That day, my road trip wasn't going very well and the temperature was very high like 40 degrees. Deadly hot. I could feel the heat from inside my body! <br />
    I decided to stop at a gas-station near Murcia. There I could do a bit of toilet and have coffee. When I came back to the place, there was another hitch-hiker who was trying to ask drivers for a ride. Per the manners of hitch-hiking, I waited for him to catch a car successfully. However, he seemed to me that he would never catch a car. <br />
    He was like a huge man, skin head, wearing a tanktop, a real chad. At least people never stopped their cars for him. Too scary.</p>

    <p>"Hi guys, where are you from?" I asked him finally. <br />
    "From the Czech Republic. I am going to the south," said the Czech chad. Then we decided to travel together for a while. I never pretend myself but in my previous road trips, I never waited more than 30 mins in my whole life. But people there never stopped their cars to give us a ride. We decided unhappily to walk 5km to a next bigger gas-station. No choice.</p>

    <p>It was 6:00 pm already when we arrived at a huge gas-station. We were exhausted. Tired. No money. However, the Czech chad made a surprise move. He asked truckdrivers for some money in the parking lots. As we looked so miserable, some kind truckdrivers gave him money and after 1 hour he got 25 euros in total(= 30USD!!). The Greatest champ chad, ever. <br />
    "Hey, Eater, let's have a small dinner there. There is a small canteen in the gas-station."<br />
    Simple tomato spaghetti with a cup of red wine made us so happy. And we talked a lot about our trips. However something strange happened. The owner-chef of the restaurant was unhappy about us. Because some truckdrivers had talked him about a money begging by a huge Czech man outside the canteen. And the owner's bad behavior made the Czech chad angry. He was saying bad words in Czech to the owner when we went out.</p>

    <p>It was already 9:00 pm. We were sitting on the bench on the other side of the canteen. The night was so calm with fresh warm wind. I was almost giving up to have a good bed that night. And something new happened. <br />
    "Eater, don't turn around now," said the Czech chad, his eyes were serious. As I didn't understand what he meant, I looked around and saw 2 black cars, which went so slowly near our bench. And the front car's black window opened down slowly. I saw 2 men wearing sunglasses. Mafi*. <br />
    "The owner called them," groaned the angry Czech chad. I felt my backbone lost somewhere, too scared. Then the 4th surprise happened.<br />
    The Czech man opened his bag and grabbed something with his left hand. I saw him wearing a meriken**, a weapon for a street fight. <br />
    "What's going on?" shouted my heart.<br />
    He, the Czech chad, walked to the car and said something to the sunglass mafi* man in Spanish. To my eyes, his approach was very natural without doubts.<br />
    Then the next moment, at my 5th surprise, the cars moved out from us. They were scared of the Czech chad.</p>

    <p>And the next moment there came the police. It wasn't a surprise anymore to me. They asked us our passports and asked what we were doing out there. We said we were travelers.<br />
    "Please check out around, there are some bad guys with black cars," said the Czech chad to the police. And as the police car went out to watch around, we both walked out of the cursed gas-station. <br />
    We walked 100 meters together, slowly.<br />
    "I am going to the forest now to look for the black cars. Do you wanna come with me?" asked me the Czech chad. I thought about the answer for a while. And I said no, and we shaked hands. It was a hard time for me. But it's the time to say good bye.<br /> 
    And the Czech chad nodded and, disappeared slowly into the night darkness. </p>
